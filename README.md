# FLOW to MDH

A generic script for use in Boomi Flow Services which query MDH.

Flow's query XML structure varies in form and is difficult to handle in Boomi.

This script dynamically converts it to a standard RecordQueryRequest.

Warning - It's not 100% complete - Sorting and filters still need implementing
